### Part I: Analytical Option Formula

1. Derived SDE of Black-Scholes Model and price variable options (e.g. Vanilla Call)
(Assuming the underlying stock is valued at a risk neutral probability with a risk-free bond used as the numeraire 
security)
 
2. Derived SDE of Bachelier Model and price variable options (e.g. Vanilla Call)
(Assuming risk-free interest rate, r, = 0) 

3. Derived SDE of Black76 Model and price variable options (e.g. Vanilla Call) 

4. Derived SDE of Displaced-Diffusion Model and price variable options (e.g. Vanilla Call) 

### Part II: Model Calibration
Calibration of displaced diffusion model and SBAR model to match market implied volatility derived from Black-76 
Lognormal option pricing model 

1. The Implied volatility from market prices were extracted using the Black-76 Lognormal option pricing model

2. Using Displaced-Diffusion Model and SABR model (fix Î² = 0.8) for Model Calibration and then compare the results

### Part III: Static Replication
Evaluate the payoff using Black-Scholes Model and Bachelier Model

### Part IV: Dynamic Hedging
Using Black-Scholes model to simulate the stock price, sell at-the-money call option, and hedge N times during the life 
of the call option to test the final profit and loss of our dynamic hedging strategy
(Assume there are 21 trading days over the month)
